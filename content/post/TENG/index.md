Vibration-based energy harvesting using triboelectric transduction has been widely concerned due to recent surge of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which provides a more convenient alternative to traditional power sources, without the large maintenance costs for periodic battery replacement and serious pollution resulted from the conventional chemical batteries. 

However, the energy collected by most of the existing triboelectric nano-generators (TENG) has relatively low power intensity (~Î¼W/mWâˆ™[cm]^(-3)) and fluctuating amplitudes, which means that, an effective energy management circuit is extremely necessary for further utilization of such energy. Most traditional energy harvesting technologies often employ complicate energy management circuit and control algorithms with many active electronic components, which results in a significant amount of intrinsic power consumption. If the harvested energy is not sufficient to supply the active circuit, energy from the back-end storage capacitor will be consumed alternatively. Once the energy storage being exhausted, the entire system will paralyze and canâ€™t be waken up again. 

The power consumption of the active energy management circuits, for example, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit and other auxiliary circuits, are often ignored in many reports but have a great importance in further reduction of the intrinsic power consumption without the external loads, especially for the micro power-generation systems. 

**In these cases, MEMS switch seems to be a more promising alternative for energy management, with the properties of passive, zero leakage current and the potential to be self-started.**

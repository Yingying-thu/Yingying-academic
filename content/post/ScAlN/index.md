title: Piezoelectric Scandium Aluminum Nitride thin film deposition and characterization
subtitle: Visiting Student Researcher, Stanford University, CA
summary: Aluminum Nitride (AlN) is a well-known piezoelectric material with a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, which is often used as thin film in SAW/BAW and energy harvesting devices. Compared to PZT, AlN has relatively low piezoelectric coefficients, but it also has lower dielectric constant and better mechanical properties. Scandium doped AlN (ScAlN) is promising to improve the piezoelectric coefficient (e33 and d33) of pure AlN to be much higher.

## Install Python and JupyterLab

[Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.

Alternatively, install JupyterLab with `pip3 install jupyterlab`.

## Create or upload a Jupyter notebook

Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting `<MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>` and `<SHORT-POST-TITLE>` with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:

```bash
mkdir -p <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
cd <MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER>/content/post/<SHORT-POST-TITLE>/
jupyter lab index.ipynb
```

The `jupyter` command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.

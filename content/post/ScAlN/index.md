title: Piezoelectric Scandium Aluminum Nitride thin film deposition and characterization
subtitle: Visiting Student Researcher, Stanford University, CA
summary: Aluminum Nitride (AlN) is a well-known piezoelectric material with a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure, which is often used as thin film in SAW/BAW and energy harvesting devices. Compared to PZT, AlN has relatively low piezoelectric coefficients, but it also has lower dielectric constant and better mechanical properties. Scandium doped AlN (ScAlN) is promising to improve the piezoelectric coefficient (e33 and d33) of pure AlN to be much higher.

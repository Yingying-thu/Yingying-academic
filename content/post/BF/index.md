Impedance measurement across a pair of electrodes in a bio-chip has been widely demonstrated for the quantification of various biological activities, such as enzymes, antibodies and antigens, DNA and cells.Multiple parameters must be measured in real-time to correlate cellular events with genomic information and thus understand complex cellular processes.

In previous projects of our group, glass rings of millimetres diameter were used for biosensor encapsulation to form a container for biomolecule incubation and detection. Because of its large surface area in contact with the environment, the biosensing signals fluctuated significantly by various factors (e.g. temperature, pH, etc.). The combination of diverse automated devices for real-time biosensing measurements holds tremendous promise for optimization. 
 
In general, the micro-fluidic setup offers several benefits over conventionally sized systems, allowing the analysis and usage of less sample volume, chemicals and reagents. To accurately manage fluids inside the micro-channels, specific systems are required.

In this paper, a bio-sensor that combined a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) transducer and a detector was used for bio-molecule detection. It is well-known that graphene oxide (GO) could be reduced into rGO with the use of various light sources, including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, flash lamp, sunlight and lasers. Here we adopted the thermal reduction method to further convert the GO thin-film into semiconductor reduced graphene oxide. Then it was deposited onto the top of gold interdigitated electrodes (IDEs), which guarantees a high conductivity and high sensitivity of the bio-sensing process.

A complete measuring system was designed, integrating a liquid Autosampler, a LabSmith workstation and an Ivium CompactStation, to realize the real-time impedance measurement for different bio-molecules. A micro-fluidic system and rGO bio-chips are developed for the analysis of liquid inside the channels. Finally, the whole system was controlled by LabviewTM for data post-processing. Such coordinated design between several automatic devices provides convenience to the users, which has the potential to lower the cost, increase accuracy and reduce the labor involved in performing essays, as compared to traditional setups. The challenge lies both in the development of integrated software interface and the compact connection of different instruments.

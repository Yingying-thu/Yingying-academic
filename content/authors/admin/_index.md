I'm now a graduate student at Tsinghua Intelligent Micro Systems Lab. My research interests focus on MEMS switches, micro-machining process, power electronics and energy harvesting devices. 

I have double master's degree in both China and Germany and over 3 years experience managing multiple projects including micro-sensors, micro-machining process and micro-energy.
